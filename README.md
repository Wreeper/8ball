# 8ball
Simple 8ball API written in PHP in under 5 minutes.
# How to use?
Simply get the 8ball.php file, send a GET request to it and that's all you really have to do.
# Why?
I noticed that multiple simple 8ball API's are too complicated, created using node, need to deploy images blahblahblah. This simple code does exactly what that API does but it's 10 times easier to deploy.
# Is there a online API running this?
Sure! You can send a GET request to https://api.wreeper.top/8ball and read the "answer" JSON response.
# Again, why?
I also noticed many projects using a external 8ball API for some reason? Whatever the use case is, all of them are too complicated. I aim to fix just one of the world's million problems. To be honest, I spent more time on the readme than on coding this.
